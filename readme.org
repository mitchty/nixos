* My out of band nix packages/modules flake repo

  For now this is a bit of a "before I upstream things to nixpkgs" test bed of stuff.

  About the only thing of huge note is probably the [[file:bin/versions.sh][versions]] script that checks for newer package versions.

  About the only things of note is I'm packaging the following not in nixpkgs:
    - [[https://github.com/blacknon/hwatch][hwatch]] A watch command with history mostly...

  Anything else in here should be considered a work in progress and thus ignored.
